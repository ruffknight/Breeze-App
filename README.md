![Breeze App](https://i.ibb.co/hYqTsKF/breeze.png)

## Introduction

Amidst the challenges posed by the pandemic, maintaining mental well-being has become a crucial aspect of our lives. Breeze, a mindfulness and well-being app, emerged from a collaborative effort by a dedicated team of six engineers during the User-Centered Design 2020/2021 course project. The application aims to provide users with tools to navigate these uncertain times and promote mental wellness and stress management.

## Project Overview

Breeze was conceptualized as a response to the unique challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team, comprising individuals with diverse skills, came together to develop an application that would address the evolving needs of individuals during these trying times. The process included a project pitch, user research as well as findings analysis and synthesis, prototyping (from low to high fidelity), user testing throughout, and the development of a functional prototype. Every week the team prepared visual presentations distilling the prior week's efforts and findings. In the end the team prepared a final presentation summarizing the process and produced a report documenting the process and final product achieved. The app's core features include guided meditation, to-do list management, and access to resources for seeking help when needed.

### Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following stack:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend development.
- Figma for high fidelity prototyping.
- Git for version control and remote collaboration of the team.
